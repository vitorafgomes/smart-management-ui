# Vault Operation Schema

This file is the operation contract for Claude when working on this wiki. It is **project-agnostic** — it defines HOW Claude operates on the vault, not WHAT this project is. Project-specific content lives in `pages/`.

Read this file at session start (or rely on the root-repo `CLAUDE.md` to auto-include it). Follow it verbatim unless the user overrides.

---

## Three-layer model

```
raw/          immutable user-curated sources (Claude reads, never edits)
pages/        LLM-maintained wiki (Claude writes, user reviews)
wiki-*.md     skill config + schema (Claude obeys, user rarely edits)
index.md      content catalog (Claude maintains)
log.md        append-only chronological log (Claude appends)
```

## Session start protocol

On every session, before any code grep or file read:

1. Read `index.md`.
2. Classify the user's task:
   - **Feature** — net-new capability or endpoint.
   - **Bug fix** — correcting existing behavior.
   - **Refactor** — restructuring without behavior change.
   - **Investigation** — answering a question about the codebase.
   - **Lint** — health-checking the vault itself.
3. Route via the table below.
4. Read every routed page before proposing or coding anything.
5. Only after the vault is exhausted, grep source.

## Task routing

| Task | Pages Claude reads first | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|
| **Feature** | `pages/services/<affected>.md` → linked `pages/invariants/*` → `pages/decisions/*` related → `pages/conventions/*` | Propose design; cross-check against invariants; draft tests referenced in service page |
| **Bug fix** | `pages/services/<affected>.md` → `pages/invariants/*` touching the bug surface → `pages/incidents/*` for similar past issues | Check if bug violates a documented invariant — if so, that's the fix target |
| **Refactor** | `pages/services/<affected>.md` → `pages/decisions/*` that established the current shape → `pages/conventions/*` | If the refactor contradicts an ADR, draft a superseding ADR first |
| **Investigation** | `pages/overview/*` → `index.md` → targeted pages | Answer with citations `[[pages/...]]` |
| **Lint** | all of `pages/`, `index.md`, `log.md` | Run `/wiki-lint` skill |
| **New ADR** | relevant `pages/services/*` and `pages/invariants/*` | Copy `templates/_adr.md`, increment ADR number, link to superseded ADR if any |
| **New invariant** | affected `pages/services/*` | Copy `templates/_invariant.md`, cite file:line enforcement points + tests |

## Page conventions

All pages use the schema in `wiki-schema.md`. Mandatory frontmatter: `title`, `version`, `date`, `changes`, `page_type`.

Extended `page_type` values (beyond vanillaflava defaults):
- `service` — a page under `pages/services/`, one per service or bounded context.
- `adr` — an Architecture Decision Record under `pages/decisions/`. Filename format `NNNN-<slug>.md`.
- `invariant` — a rule the code must preserve, under `pages/invariants/`.
- `incident` — a per-incident page under `pages/incidents/`.
- `runbook` — an operational procedure under `pages/runbooks/`.
- `roadmap` — an initiative or backlog page under `pages/roadmap/`.
- `convention` — a coding/testing/db convention under `pages/conventions/`.

## Operations

### Ingest

Trigger: user drops a file in `raw/<kind>/` and invokes `/wiki-ingest`.

Claude:
1. Reads the source.
2. Classifies it and identifies affected pages (create or update).
3. Writes/updates pages. Adds `source: [raw/...]` frontmatter on created pages.
4. Updates `index.md` with any new pages.
5. Moves the source from `raw/<kind>/` to `ingested/<kind>/` atomically.
6. Appends a log entry: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | <title>`.

A single source typically touches 5–15 pages.

### Query

Trigger: user asks a question about the project.

Claude:
1. Reads `index.md`.
2. Reads any directly-named pages + wikilinked pages up to 2 hops.
3. Synthesizes answer with `[[page]]` citations.
4. If the answer is valuable (novel synthesis, comparison, decision rationale), offers to file it via `/wiki-crystallize`.
5. Appends a log entry: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] query | <short question>`.

### Lint

Trigger: user invokes `/wiki-lint` or periodically.

Claude checks:
- **Broken wikilinks** — `[[page]]` references that resolve to nothing.
- **Orphans** — pages under `pages/` with no inbound links.
- **Stale claims** — pages last `updated:` >90 days ago that reference files/lines; verify paths still exist.
- **Missing cross-references** — a service page mentions a concept that has its own domain page but doesn't link it.
- **Frontmatter violations** — missing mandatory fields, invalid enum values.
- **Drift** — `file:line` references in service pages that no longer resolve.

Report findings; don't auto-fix without confirmation.

### Crystallize

Trigger: user invokes `/wiki-crystallize` at the end of a working session.

Claude:
1. Reviews the session transcript.
2. Identifies new facts, decisions, invariants, or surprises worth persisting.
3. Proposes new pages or updates to existing ones.
4. On confirmation, writes with `source: [chat]` or `source: [raw/...]` as appropriate.
5. Increments `crystallize_count` frontmatter.

## Rules for Claude

1. **Never write to `raw/`.** Claude reads raw, writes pages, moves raw → ingested during ingest.
2. **Every page has `source:` frontmatter** pointing to where its content came from (raw file, chat, or another page).
3. **Never invent file:line references.** If Claude can't verify a path, it says so; it does not guess.
4. **Invariants are load-bearing.** Before proposing any code change, cross-check against `pages/invariants/*` linked from the affected service page. A change that violates an invariant needs either the change to be revised OR a superseding ADR that removes the invariant.
5. **One page per topic.** If a page exceeds ~300 lines, split it. **Exemption:** list-shaped trackers and manifests (`pages/roadmap/active-followups.md`, `pages/roadmap/optimization-sweep.md`, `pages/overview/endpoints-manifest.md`) may exceed the limit — splitting a single prioritized list destroys its value; prune closed entries instead.
6. **Wikilinks over "see also" lists.** Inline links build the graph; bottom-of-page link dumps decay.
7. **Frontmatter is skill territory, body is human territory.** Skills overwrite known frontmatter fields; they never delete human prose.
8. **Append-only `log.md`.** New entries at the top. Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <title>`.

## When in doubt

- **The wiki doesn't have an answer to a user question** → say so, grep source, then `/wiki-crystallize` the findings at the end.
- **Two pages contradict each other** → surface the contradiction, ask the user to arbitrate, file an ADR for the resolution.
- **A user asks a question that crosses many pages** → answer by citing the pages; then offer to file the synthesis as a new page.
- **A proposed change would touch 10+ pages** → propose the change set as a dry-run first; apply after confirmation.

## Do not

- Do not write project content without a source. The first sentence of any page must be backable by a citation.
- Do not deep-link to code as the only form of evidence; link to the invariant/ADR/convention page that governs the code.
- Do not rewrite history. Supersede; don't edit-over.
- Do not add skills or tools without documenting them in `pages/conventions/tooling.md`.
