# <Flow name>

> One-sentence summary of what end-to-end behavior this flow delivers and why it crosses service boundaries.

## Trigger

What initiates the flow. HTTP route + caller, Service Bus event + producer, timer + cadence, or upstream flow.

## Services touched

Ordered list of services in the order they execute. Link each [[pages/services/*]].

1. [[pages/services/<svc>]] - *role in this flow (validates / debits / publishes)*
2. [[pages/services/<svc>]] - *role*

## Steps

Numbered, code-anchored. Each step cites `file:line` for the entry point. **Never invent a path** - if the path can't be verified, mark it `?`.

1. **<Step name>** - `src/<path>.cs:LINE`. What happens here in one sentence. What it produces.
2. **<Step name>** - `src/<path>.cs:LINE`. What happens here. What it produces.

## Invariants this flow must preserve

Every [[pages/invariants/*]] that constrains a step in this flow. If a step would violate one, the step (or the invariant) is wrong.

- [[pages/invariants/<name>]] - *which step this constrains*

## Failure modes

- **<Failure>** - what happens, where it surfaces, how the flow recovers. Cite `file:line` of the handler.
- **<Failure>** - same.

## Idempotency / replay

How the flow handles duplicate triggers, retries, or partial completion. Cite the dedup key or version stamp.

## Tests

- **Integration:** `tests/<service>.Tests/Integration/...` - what scenario.
- **Contract (Pact):** `pacts/<consumer>-<provider>.json` - which interactions cover which step.
- **End-to-end:** if any.
